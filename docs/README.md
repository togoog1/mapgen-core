# MapGen Documentation

This folder collects living documentation for the project: architecture, development workflow, API, UI, and per-generator notes.

- Architecture: `archive/architecture.md` (archived)
- Getting started: see root README.md and component READMEs
- Development workflow: `archive/EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (archived)
- Core generators overview: `../Core/MapGen.Core/README.md`
- Perâ€‘generator guides: `../Core/MapGen.Core/docs/`
- Service API: `../Service/README.md`
- Viewer UI: `../Viewer/README.md`

Conventions

- Keep docs next to the code they describe when possible (e.g., generator docs under `Core/MapGen.Core/docs`).
- Use checklists for validation; prefer determinism and seam checks for image tiles.
- Include parameter defaults, tuning tips, and known artifacts.
